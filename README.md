This repository contains the source code and documentation for an MQTT-based Smart Home Light Control System. The project involves setting up an MQTT broker on Laptop #1 and connecting four MQTT clients, including Raspberry Pi devices and a laptop or smartphone. The system utilizes an LDR and a potentiometer to sense light levels and control LED lights, offering both manual and automated lighting adjustments. It demonstrates how MQTT messaging can be leveraged for home automation and provides a comprehensive guide for implementation
